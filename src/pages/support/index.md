## Community Support

Share in the knowledge and experiences of the community by chatting on
Discord, or filing issues on GitHub. Please be respectful of and grateful for
community members' time.

### Sponsorship

PostGraphile is crowd-funded - we rely on users to become individual or
corporate sponsors and support our work on the PostGraphile project, and to
enable us to keep the extremely permissive MIT license.

Sponsoring PostGraphile's ongoing development and maintenance is in your
interest; resulting in faster features and fixes, and better documentation.

[Read more about sponsorship](/sponsor/)

### Code of Conduct

The Graphile project is covered by [our code of
conduct](/postgraphile/code-of-conduct/). Please be
respectful of all people and property.

### Community chat

## Professional Services

Leverage the knowledge and experience of PostGraphile's maintainer, Benjie,
and give back to ongoing maintainence and development of the project.

### Professional support, from $250/mo

Email us at
[team@graphile.org](mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Support%20Contract) for
more information.

### Open source feature development

If PostGraphile lacks a feature you want, you can get in touch and ask about
sponsoring the feature. We'll arrange a time to chat about the feature to
ensure we have a shared understanding, it addresses your needs and is
feasible, and to determine the time-frames. Assuming we can help you, we'll
then follow up with a quote for how much it will cost, and a contract for
your review. Open source features you sponsor will remain our property, but
we will make them available to you under the terms of the MIT license.

Email us at <a href="mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Graphile%20Custom%20Work">team@graphile.org</a>
for details.

### Consultancy

Consultancy services (advice, code review, training, support, debugging) can
be purchased in bundles of 8 or more hours, and consumed in a small number of
sessions over a period of 8 weeks.

Email us at <a href="mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Graphile%20Consultancy">team@graphile.org</a>
for details.

### How quickly can I expect a response?

We aim to respond to all messages by the end of the next working day (UK
calendar); often it will be much (much) sooner.
