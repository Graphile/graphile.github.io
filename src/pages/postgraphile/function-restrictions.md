## Function Restrictions

PostGraphile supports a wide range of PostgreSQL functions, the only major class of functions we don't support currently are VARIADIC functions.

### Thanks

This page used to be a lot larger; until community contributor Matt Bretl swooped in and lifted almost all the restrictions &mdash; thanks Matt!
