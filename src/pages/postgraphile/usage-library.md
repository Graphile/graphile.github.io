## Using PostGraphile as a Library

Some people may want to use PostGraphile as a dependency of their current
Node.js projects instead of as a CLI tool. If this is the approach you want to
take then you may either use PostGraphile as an HTTP middleware, or create and
execute queries against a PostGraphile schema using your own custom code. In
this article we will go the former, for the latter see [Schema-only
Usage](/postgraphile/usage-schema/).

### HTTP Middleware

To mount a PostGraphile instance on your own web server there is an export
`postgraphile` from the `postgraphile` package that can be used as HTTP
middleware for the following HTTP frameworks:

* [`connect`](http://npmjs.com/connect)
* [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Vanilla `http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)

_We also have alpha-quality support for [`koa`
2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa), if you notice any problems [please raise a GitHub issue about it.](https://www.github.com/graphile/postgraphile)_

To use PostGraphile with `express`, for instance, just do the following:

```js
const express = require("express");
const { postgraphile } = require("postgraphile");

const app = express();

app.use(postgraphile(process.env.DATABASE_URL || "postgres:///"));

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```

Or to use it with the built-in `http` module:

```js
const http = require("http");
const { postgraphile } = require("postgraphile");

http
  .createServer(postgraphile(process.env.DATABASE_URL || "postgres:///"))
  .listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```

#### API: `postgraphile(pgConfig, schemaName, options)`

The `postgraphile` middleware factory function takes three arguments, all of which are optional. The below options are valid for <tt>postgraphile@<!-- LIBRARY_VERSION_BEGIN -->4.1.0<!-- LIBRARY_VERSION_END --></tt>.

* **`pgConfig`**: An object or string that will be passed to the [`pg`][] library and used to connect to a PostgreSQL backend, OR a pg.Pool to use.
* **`schemaName`**: A string, or array of strings, which specifies the PostgreSQL schema(s) you to expose via PostGraphile; defaults to 'public'
* **`options`**: An object containing other miscellaneous options. Options include: <!-- LIBRARY_DOCBLOCK_BEGIN -->
  * `watchPg`: When true, PostGraphile will update the GraphQL API whenever your database schema changes. This feature requires some changes to your database in the form of the [`postgraphile_watch`](https://github.com/graphile/graphile-engine/blob/master/packages/graphile-build-pg/res/watch-fixtures.sql) schema; PostGraphile will try to add this itself but requires DB superuser privileges to do so. If PostGraphile can't install it, you can do so manually. PostGraphile will not drop the schema when it exits, to remove it you can execute: `DROP SCHEMA postgraphile_watch CASCADE;`
  * `pgDefaultRole`: The default Postgres role to use. If no role was provided in a provided JWT token, this role will be used.
  * `dynamicJson`: By default, JSON and JSONB fields are presented as strings (JSON encoded) from the GraphQL schema. Setting this to `true` (recommended) enables raw JSON input and output, saving the need to parse / stringify JSON manually.
  * `setofFunctionsContainNulls`: If none of your `RETURNS SETOF compound_type` functions mix NULLs with the results then you may set this true to reduce the nullables in the GraphQL schema.
  * `classicIds`: Enables classic ids for Relay support. Instead of using the field name `nodeId` for globally unique ids, PostGraphile will instead use the field name `id` for its globally unique ids. This means that table `id` columns will also get renamed to `rowId`.
  * `disableDefaultMutations`: Setting this to `true` will prevent the creation of the default mutation types & fields. Database mutation will only be possible through Postgres functions.
  * `ignoreRBAC`: Set false (recommended) to exclude fields, queries and mutations that the user isn't permitted to access from the generated GraphQL schema; set this option true to skip these checks and create GraphQL fields and types for everything. The default is `true`, in v5 the default will change to `false`.
  * `ignoreIndexes`: Set false (recommended) to exclude filters, orderBy, and relations that would be expensive to access due to missing indexes. Changing this from true to false is a breaking change, but false to true is not, so we recommend you start with it set to `false`. The default is `true`, in v5 the default may change to `false`.
  * `includeExtensionResources`: By default, tables and functions that come from extensions are excluded from the generated GraphQL schema as general applications don't need them to be exposed to the end user. You can use this flag to include them in the generated schema (not recommended).
  * `showErrorStack`: Enables adding a `stack` field to the error response. Can be either the boolean `true` (which results in a single stack string) or the string `json` (which causes the stack to become an array with elements for each line of the stack). Recommended in development, not recommended in production.
  * `extendedErrors`: Extends the error response with additional details from the Postgres error. Can be any combination of `['hint', 'detail', 'errcode']`. Default is `[]`.
  * `handleErrors`: Enables ability to modify errors before sending them down to the client. Optionally can send down custom responses. If you use this then `showErrorStack` and `extendedError` may have no effect.
  * `appendPlugins`: An array of [Graphile Engine](/graphile-build/plugins/) schema plugins to load after the default plugins.
  * `prependPlugins`: An array of [Graphile Engine](/graphile-build/plugins/) schema plugins to load before the default plugins (you probably don't want this).
  * `replaceAllPlugins`: The full array of [Graphile Engine](/graphile-build/plugins/) schema plugins to use for schema generation (you almost definitely don't want this!).
  * `skipPlugins`: An array of [Graphile Engine](/graphile-build/plugins/) schema plugins to skip.
  * `readCache`: A file path string. Reads cached values from local cache file to improve startup time (you may want to do this in production).
  * `writeCache`: A file path string. Writes computed values to local cache file so startup can be faster (do this during the build phase).
  * `exportJsonSchemaPath`: Enables saving the detected schema, in JSON format, to the given location. The directories must exist already, if the file exists it will be overwritten.
  * `exportGqlSchemaPath`: Enables saving the detected schema, in GraphQL schema format, to the given location. The directories must exist already, if the file exists it will be overwritten.
  * `graphqlRoute`: The endpoint the GraphQL executer will listen on. Defaults to `/graphql`.
  * `graphiqlRoute`: The endpoint the GraphiQL query interface will listen on (**NOTE:** GraphiQL will not be enabled unless the `graphiql` option is set to `true`). Defaults to `/graphiql`.
  * `externalUrlBase`: If you are using watch mode, or have enabled GraphiQL, and you either mount PostGraphile under a path, or use PostGraphile behind some kind of proxy that puts PostGraphile under a subpath (or both!) then you must specify this setting so that PostGraphile can figure out it's external URL. (e.g. if you do `app.use('/path/to', postgraphile(...))`), which is not officially supported, then you should pass `externalUrlBase: '/path/to'`.) This setting should never end in a slash (`/`). To specify that the external URL is the expected one, either omit this setting or set it to the empty string `''`.
  * `graphiql`: Set this to `true` to enable the GraphiQL interface.
  * `enhanceGraphiql`: Set this to `true` to add some enhancements to GraphiQL; intended for development usage only.
  * `enableCors`: Enables some generous CORS settings for the GraphQL endpoint. There are some costs associated when enabling this, if at all possible try to put your API behind a reverse proxy.
  * `bodySizeLimit`: Set the maximum size of HTTP request bodies that can be parsed (default 100kB). The size can be given as a human-readable string, such as '200kB' or '5MB' (case insensitive).
  * `enableQueryBatching`: [Experimental] Enable the middleware to process multiple GraphQL queries in one request.
  * `jwtSecret`: The secret for your JSON web tokens. This will be used to verify tokens in the `Authorization` header, and signing JWT tokens you return in procedures.
  * `jwtVerifyOptions`: Options with which to perform JWT verification - see https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback If 'audience' property is unspecified, it will default to ['postgraphile']; to prevent audience verification set it explicitly to null.
  * `jwtRole`: A comma separated list of strings that give a path in the jwt from which to extract the postgres role. If none is provided it will use the key `role` on the root of the jwt.
  * `jwtPgTypeIdentifier`: The Postgres type identifier for the compound type which will be signed as a JWT token if ever found as the return type of a procedure. Can be of the form: `my_schema.my_type`. You may use quotes as needed: `"my-special-schema".my_type`.
  * `jwtAudiences`: [DEPRECATED] The audience to use when verifing the JWT token. Deprecated, use `jwtVerifyOptions.audience` instead.
  * `legacyRelations`: Some one-to-one relations were previously detected as one-to-many - should we export 'only' the old relation shapes, both new and old but mark the old ones as 'deprecated' (default), or 'omit' (recommended) the old relation shapes entirely.
  * `legacyJsonUuid`: ONLY use this option if you require the v3 typenames 'Json' and 'Uuid' over 'JSON' and 'UUID'.
  * `disableQueryLog`: Turns off GraphQL query logging. By default PostGraphile will log every GraphQL query it processes along with some other information. Set this to `true` (recommended in production) to disable that feature.
  * `pgSettings`: A plain object specifying custom config values to set in the PostgreSQL transaction (accessed via `current_setting('my.custom.setting')`) **or** an (optionally asynchronous) function which will return the same (or a Promise to the same) based on the incoming web request (e.g. to extract session data).
  * `additionalGraphQLContextFromRequest`: Some Graphile Engine schema plugins may need additional information available on the `context` argument to the resolver - you can use this function to provide such information based on the incoming request - you can even use this to change the response [experimental], e.g. setting cookies.
  * `pluginHook`: [experimental] Plugin hook function, enables functionality within PostGraphile to be expanded with plugins. Generate with `makePluginHook(plugins)` passing a list of plugin objects.
  * `simpleCollections`: Should we use relay pagination, or simple collections? "omit" (default) - relay connections only, "only" (not recommended) - simple collections only (no Relay connections), "both" - both.
  * `queryCacheMaxSize`: Max query cache size in MBs of queries. Default, 50MB.

<!-- LIBRARY_DOCBLOCK_END -->

The following options are not part of PostGraphile core, but are available from the Supporter and/or Pro plugins - see [Go Pro!](/postgraphile/pricing/) for more information.

* **`options`**:
  * `simpleSubscriptions`: [SUPPORTER] ⚡️[experimental] set this to `true` to add simple subscription support
  * `subscriptionAuthorizationFunction [fn]` [SUPPORTER] ⚡️[experimental] set this to the name (excluding arguments/parentheses) of a PG function to call to check user is allowed to subscribe
  * `readOnlyConnection` [PRO] ⚡️[experimental] set this to a PostgreSQL connection string to use for read-only queries (i.e. not mutations)
  * `defaultPaginationCap` [PRO] ⚡️[experimental] integer, ensure all connections have first/last specified and are no large than this value (default: 50), set to -1 to disable; override via smart comment `@paginationCap 50`
  * `graphqlDepthLimit` [PRO] ⚡️[experimental] integer, validate GraphQL queries are no deeper than the specified int (default: 16), set to -1 to disable
  * `graphqlCostLimit` [PRO] ⚡️[experimental] integer, only allows queries with a computed cost below the specified int (default: 1000), set to -1 to disable
  * `exposeGraphQLCost` [PRO] boolean, if true (default) then the calculated query cost will be exposed on the resulting payload

### Exposing HTTP request data to PostgreSQL

#### `pgSettings` function

Using the `pgSettings` functionality mentioned above you can extend the data
made available through `current_setting(...)` within PostgreSQL. Instead of
passing an object you can pass an (optionally asynchronous) function which will
be executed for each request, and the results merged in with the other settings
PostGraphile automatically adds to the request.

For example:

```js
export postgraphile(process.env.DATABASE_URL, schemaName, {
  pgSettings: async req => ({
    'user.id': `${req.session.passport.user}`,
    'http.headers.x-something': `${req.headers['x-something']}`,
    'http.method': `${req.method}`,
    'http.url': `${req.url}`,
    //...
  }),
})
```

```sql
create function get_x_something() returns text as $$
  select current_setting('http.headers.x-something', true)::text;
$$ language sql stable;
```

Everything returned by `pgSettings` is applied to the current session with
`set_config($key, $value, true)`; note that `set_config` only supports string
values so it is best to only feed `pgSettings` string values (we'll convert other
values using the `String` constructor function, which may not have the effect
you intend.

You can use `pgSettings` to define variables that your Postgres
functions/policies depend on, or to tweak internal Postgres settings. When
adding variables for your own usage, the keys **must** contain either one or
two period (`.`) characters, and the prefix (the bit before the first period)
must not be used by any Postgres extension. Variables without periods will be
interpreted as internal Postgres settings, such as `role`, and will be applied
by Postgres. All settings are automatically reset when the transaction
completes. Here's an example of switching the user into the Postgres 'visitor'
role, and applying the application setting `jwt.claims.user_id`:

```js
export postgraphile(process.env.DATABASE_URL, schemaName, {
  pgSettings: async req => ({
    'role': 'visitor',
    'jwt.claims.user_id': `${req.user.id}`,
    //...
  }),
})
```

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_current_user() RETURNS TEXT AS $$
  SELECT current_user;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL STABLE;
```

```graphql
{
  getCurrentUser # returns visitor
}
```

<!-- TODO: verify the above works. -->

<!-- TODO: move this to its own article? -->

### Mounting PostGraphile middleware under a subpath

This isn't officially supported; however it should work in most cases. If
you're mounting under a subpath in express then `app.use("/path/to", postgraphile())` should work automatically without requiring any options. If
you're using an external proxy then you must supply the base URL so that
PostGraphile knows where to tell the browser the assets are located. This is
all so that PostGraphile can reference different parts of itself correctly,
such as the location for the watch stream to put in the header, or the
GraphQL endpoint for GraphiQL to connect to.

A really complex use case of this would be this example:

```js
// Assuming you combine both Express subpath AND an external
// proxy which mounts your express app at `/myproxypath`, you
// should provide options like this:
app.use(
  "/path/to",
  postgraphile(db, schemas, {
    externalUrlBase: "/myproxypath/path/to",
    graphqlRoute: "/graphql",
    graphiql: true,
    graphiqlRoute: "/graphiql"
  })
);
// Then you can load GraphiQL at `/myproxypath/path/to/graphiql`
// and it will know to connect to GraphQL at
// `/myproxypath/path/to/graphql`
```

### Composing PostGraphile middleware with other middleware

Some use cases might require to mount other middleware before PostGraphile, for instance if requests to the GraphQL endpoint should be subject to an authorization / authentication mechanism.

With express, such a compositon can be done like the following:
```
// mount other middleware on the GraphQL endpoint
app.use('/graphql', authMiddleware);
// mount PostGraphile as usual
app.use(postgraphile(db, schema, options);
```
Other frameworks should work analogously.
