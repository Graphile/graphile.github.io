## PostGraphile Chat

We have a fairly active chat room on gitter:

https://gitter.im/graphile/postgraphile

This is a good place to get help, or to be involved in discussions on upcoming
features in PostGraphile.

Chat, like everything else in Graphile, is governed by our [code of
conduct](/postgraphile/code-of-conduct/), so please be careful to ensure your
language always contributes to creating a positive environment.
