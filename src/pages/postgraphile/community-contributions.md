## Community contributions

The community contributes to PostGraphile development in many ways.

One of the common ways of contributing is to write a plugin, see [Community Plugins](/postgraphile/community-plugins/) for a list of some of the plugins that have been made open source by the community.

Community embers also help each other on our [Discord chat](http://discord.gg/graphile).

And of course, we couldn't keep progressing this project like we do if it wasn't for the financial support of many [community members](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile/blob/master/SPONSORS.md).
