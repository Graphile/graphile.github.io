## Production Considerations

When you run PostGraphile in production you'll want to ensure that people
cannot easily trigger denial of service (DOS) attacks against you. Due to the
nature of GraphQL it's easy to construct a small query that could be very
expensive for the server to run, for example:

```graphql
allUsers {
  nodes {
    postsByAuthorId {
      nodes {
        commentsByPostId {
          userByAuthorId {
            postsByAuthorId {
              nodes {
                commentsByPostId {
                  userByAuthorId {
                    postsByAuthorId {
                      nodes {
                        commentsByPostId {
                          userByAuthorId {
                            id
                          }
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

There's lots of techniques for protecting your server from these kinds of
queries; a great introduction to this subject is [this blog
post](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/securing-your-graphql-api-from-malicious-queries-16130a324a6b)
from Apollo.

### Simple: Query Whitelist

If you do not intend to open your API up to third parties to run arbitrary
queries against then using persisted queries as a query whitelist to protect
your GraphQL endpoint is a good solution. This technique ensures that only the
queries you use in your own applications can be executed on the server (but you
can of course change the variables).

This technique has a few caveats:

- Your API will only accept queries that you've approved, so it's not suitable if you want third parties to run arbitrary queries
- You must be able to generate a unique ID from each query; e.g. a hash
- You must use "static GraphQL queries" - that is the queries must be known at build time of your application/webpage, and only the variables fed to those queries can change at run-time
- You must have a way of sharing these queries between the application and the server
- You must be careful not to use variables in dangerous places; for example don't write `allUsers(first: $myVar)` as a malicious attacker could set `$myVar` to 2147483647 in order to cause your server to process as much data as possible.

PostGraphile currently doesn't have this functionality built in, but it's
fairly easy to add it when using PostGraphile as an express middleware, a
simple implementation might look like this:

```js{9-18}
const postgraphile = require('postgraphile');
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

/**** BEGINNING OF CUSTOMIZATION ****/
const persistedQueries = require('./persistedQueries.json');

app.use('/graphql', async (req, res, next) => {
  // TODO: validate req.body is of the right form
  req.body.query =
    {}.hasOwnProperty.call(persistedQueries, req.body.id)
      ? persistedQueries[req.body.id]
      : null;
  next();
});
/**** END OF CUSTOMIZATION *** */

app.use(postgraphile());

app.listen(5000);
```

i.e. a simple middleware mounted before postgraphile that manipulates the request body.

I personally use my forks of Apollo's `persistgraphql` tools to help me manage
the persisted queries themselves:

- https://github.com/benjie/persistgraphql
- https://github.com/benjie/persistgraphql-webpack-plugin

These forks generate hashes rather than numbers; which make the persisted
queries consistent across multiple builds and applications (website, mobile,
browser plugin, ...).

**NOTE**: even if you're using persisted queries, it can be wise to implement
the advanced protections as it enables you to catch unnecessarily expensive
queries before you start facing performance bottlenecks down the line.


### Advanced

Using a query whitelist puts the decision in the hands of your engineers
whether a particular query should be accepted or not. Sometimes this isn't
enough - it could be that your engineers need guidance to help them avoid
common pit-falls (e.g. forgetting to put limits on collections they query), or
it could be that you wish arbitrary third parties to be able to send queries to
your API without the queries being pre-approved and without the risk of
bringing your servers to their knees.

**You are highly encouraged to purchase the [Pro Plugin [PRO]](/postgraphile/pricing/),
which implements these protections in a deeply integrated and PostGraphile
optimised way, and has the added benefit of helping sustain development and
maintenance on the project.**


The rest of this article relates to Pro Plugin's approach to addressing these
issues, though there are hints on how you might go about solving the issues for
yourself. Many of these techniques can be implemented outside of PostGraphile,
for example in an express middleware or a nginx reverse proxy between
PostGraphile and the client.

#### Sending queries to read replicas

Probably the most important thing regarding scalability is making sure that your
master database doesn't bow under the pressure of all the clients talking to it.
One way to reduce this pressure is to offload read operations to read replicas.
In GraphQL it's easy to tell if a request will perform any writes or not: if
it's a `query` then it's read-only, if it's a `mutation` then it may perform
writes.

Using `--read-only-connection <string>` [PRO] you may give PostGraphile a
separate connection string to use for queries, to compliment the connection
string passed via `--connection` which will now be used only for mutations.

(If you're using middleware, then you'll want to pass a read-only pool to the
`readReplicaPgPool`[PRO] option instead.)

> NOTE: We don't currently support the multi-host syntax for this connection
> string, but you can use a PostgreSQL proxy such a PgPool or PgBouncer between
> PostGraphile and your database to enable connecting to multiple read
> replicas.

#### Pagination caps

It's unlikely that you want users to request `allUsers` and receive back
literally all of the users in the database. More likely you want users to use
cursor-based pagination over this connection with `first` / `after`. The Pro
Plugin introduces the `--default-pagination-cap [int]` [PRO] option which
enables you to enforce a pagination cap on all connections. Whatever number
you pass will be used as the pagination cap, but you can override it on a
table-by-table basis using [smart comments](/postgraphile/smart-comments/) - in this case the `@paginationCap`[PRO] smart comment.

```sql
comment on table users is
  E'@paginationCap 20\nSomeone who can log in.';
```

#### Limiting GraphQL query depth

Most GraphQL queries tend to be only a few levels deep, queries like the deep
one at the top of this article are generally not required. You may use
`--graphql-depth-limit [int]` [PRO] to limit the depth of any GraphQL queries
that hit PostGraphile - any deeper than this will be discarded during query
validation.

#### [EXPERIMENTAL] GraphQL cost limit

The most powerful way of preventing DOS is to limit the cost of GraphQL queries
that may be executed against your GraphQL server. The Pro Plugin contains a
very early implementation of this technique, but the costs are not very
accurate yet. You may enable a cost limit with `--graphql-cost-limit [int]`
[PRO] and the calculated cost of any GraphQL queries will be made available on
`meta` field in the GraphQL payload.

If your GraphQL query is seen to be too expensive, here's some techniques to
bring the calculated cost down:

* If you've not specified a limit (`first`/`last`) on a connection, we assume
  it will return 1000 results. If you're expecting fewer than this, specify the
  maximum you'd ever expect to receive.
* Cost is based on number of expected results (without looking at the
  database!) so lower your limits on connections.
* Connections multiply the cost of their children by the number of results
  they're expected to return, so lower the limits on connections.
* Nested fields multiply costs; so pulling a connection inside a connection
  inside a connection is going to be expensive - to address this, try placing
  lower `first`/`last` values on the connections or avoiding fetching nested
  data until you need to display it (split into multiple requests / only
  request the data you need).
* Subscriptions are automatically seen as 10x as expensive as queries - try
  and minimise the amount of data your subscription requests.
* Procedure connections are treated as more expensive than table connections.
* `totalCount` on a table has a fair cost
* `totalCount` on a procedure has a higher cost
* Using `pageInfo` adds significant cost to connections
* Computed columns are seen as fairly expensive - in future we may factor in
  PostgreSQL's `COST` parameter when figuring this out.

Keep in mind this is a **very early** implementation of cost analysis, there's
much improvement to be made. Feel free to reach out with any bad costs/queries
so we can improve it.
