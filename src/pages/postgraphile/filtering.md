## Filtering

We support rudimentary filtering on [connections](/postgraphile/connections/)
using a `condition` argument. Currently this allows you to filter for specific
values (e.g. `username: "Alice"` or `category: ARTICLE`) but more advanced
filters are being discussed.

### Filter Plugin

One of the PostGraphile community members, Matt Bretl, maintains a filter
plugin with many advanced filtering capabilities, located at
[https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter);
you might like to check it out.
