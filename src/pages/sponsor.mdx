### Why is PostGraphile a "crowd-funded open-source project"?

PostGraphile is open-source to give users great freedom in how they use the
software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the project
progresses to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To make PostGraphile a project that users can rely on for years to come, it
needs to be well directed and financially sustainable.

**The absolute best way to support PostGraphile‚Äôs ongoing development efforts
is to become a sponsor.** Crowd-sourced funding enables us to spend
the most time directly working on improving PostGraphile, which you and other
PostGraphile users then benefit from.

### How is sponsorship money spent?

Sponsorship money is used to fund software development, testing,
documentation and releases of the PostGraphile and Graphile Engine software
suite. A small amount is also used to send rewards such as stickers and
learning materials to our backers.

### Is sponsorship required to use PostGraphile?

Users are not legally required to give back to the PostGraphile project, but
it is in their interest to do so.

By significantly reducing the amount of work needed to achieve business goals
and reducing running costs, PostGraphile results in huge time and money
savings for users. We encourage organizations to contribute a portion of
these savings back, enabling the project to advance more rapidly, and result
in even greater savings for your organization.
