## Hooks

The most common thing for a plugin to do is to add hooks to the builder.

Hooks allow you to manipulate the argument (specification) that is being passed
to the GraphQL object constructors before the objects are constructed. You can
think of hooks as wrappers around the original object spec, like this:

```js
const MyType = newWithHooks(GraphQLObjectType, spec);

// is equivalent to:

const MyType = new GraphQLObjectType(hook3(hook2(hook1(spec))));
```

Hooks are registered via a call to `builder.hook(hookName, hookFunction)`.

Every `hookFunction` must synchronously return a value - either the value that it was passed
or a derivative of it (preferably immutable, but we're not strict on that).

### Which hook to attach to: `hookName`

The `hookName` that you register via `builder.hook(hookName, hookFunction)`
must match one of the supported hooks. See [All
Hooks](/graphile-build/all-hooks/) for a list of all the hooks we support,
here's a brief overview of some of the more important ones:

- `build`: extend the [Build object](/graphile-build/build-object/) passed to all other hooks

- `init`: perform setup after `build` freezes but before building the schema starts

- `GraphQLSchema`: root-level schema - hook to add `query`,
  `mutation` or `subscription` fields; called implicitly by `buildSchema(plugins, options)`

- When creating a `GraphQLObjectType` via
  `newWithHooks`:

  - `GraphQLObjectType` add/remove any root-level attributes, e.g. add a description
  - `GraphQLObjectType:interfaces` add/remove interfaces
  - `GraphQLObjectType:fields` add/remove fields (delayed)
  - `GraphQLObjectType:fields:field`: manipulate individual field spec, e.g.
    add a description
  - `GraphQLObjectType:fields:field:args` add/remove arguments to an individual field

- When creating a `GraphQLInputObjectType` via
  `newWithHooks`:

  - `GraphQLInputObjectType` add/remove root-level attributes, e.g. description
  - `GraphQLInputObjectType:fields` add/remove additional fields to this object type (delayed)
  - `GraphQLInputObjectType:fields:field`: customize an individual field from above

- When creating a `GraphQLEnumType` via `newWithHooks`:

  - `GraphQLEnumType` add/remove any root-level attributes, e.g. add a description
  - `GraphQLEnumType:values` add/remove values
  - `GraphQLEnumType:values:value` customize an individual value from above

The "(delayed)" hooks above (and their descendents) are not called until
*after* the object is constructed (which means they can reference the object
itself - allowing circular references such as our `type Query { query: Query }`
circular type); GraphQL will automatically call them when `Type.getFields()` is
called, which may still be within the same tick - i.e. they are not fully
asynchronous.

### What to do when that hook fires: `hookFunction`

The `hookFunction` that you register via `builder.hook(hookName, hookFunction)` will be called with 3 arguments:

1. The input object (e.g. the spec that would be passed to the GraphQLObjectType constructor)
2. The `Build` object (see below)
3. The `Context` object (see below) which contains a `scope` property

#### Input object

Depending on the hook being called the input object might be an array (as in
the case of `GraphQLObjectType:interfaces`) or an object (as in all other
cases, currently).  See [All Hooks](/graphile-build/all-hooks/) for a list of
all the hooks, their input types, etc

#### Build object (`Build`)

The build object (see [Build Object](/graphile-build/build-object/)) contains a
number of helpers and sources of information relevant to the current build of
the GraphQL API. If you're in watch mode then every time a new schema is
generated a new build object will be used.

Plugins may extend the `build` object via the `build` hook. Once the `build`
hook is complete the build object is frozen.

The most commonly used methods are:

- `build.extend(obj1, obj2)` - returns a new object based on a non-destructive
  merge of `obj1` and `obj2` (will not overwrite keys!) - normally used at the
  return value for a hook
- `build.graphql` - equivalent to `require('graphql')`, but helps ensure
  GraphQL version clashes do not occur

See [Build Object](/graphile-build/build-object/)) for the rest.

#### Context object (`Context`)

The context object (see [Context Object](/graphile-build/context-object/)) contains
the information relevant to the current hook. Most importantly it contains the
`scope` (an object based on the third argument passed to `newWithHooks`) but it
also contains a number of other useful things. Here's some of the more commonly
used ones:

- `scope` - an object based on the third argument to `newWithHooks` or
  `fieldWithHooks`; for deeper hooks (such as `GraphQLObjectType:fields:field`)
  the scope from shallower hooks (such as `GraphQLObjectType`) are merged in.
- `Self` - only available on hooks that are called after the object is created
  (e.g. `GraphQLObjectType:fields`), this contains the object that has been
  created allowing recursive references.
- `fieldWithHooks(fieldName, spec, scope = {})` - on `GraphQLObjectType:fields`, used for adding a field if
  you need access to the field helpers (or want to define a scope)

### Namespaces

Properties added to the `Build` object or set on the `Context.scope` should be
namespaced so that they do not conflict; for example `postgraphile` uses
the `pg` namespace: `pgSql`, `pgIntrospection`, `isPgTableType`, etc
